Prompt1

```text
Suggest a design for the implementation of the IAnalyzer that meets the fillowing requirements. Modify Action type if needed. Follow SOLID principles.

    - Determine which coverage footnotes need to be updated or created.  
    - Identify which bare requirement names need coverage annotations appended.  
    - Compare file hashes in reqmdfiles.json to actual git hash-object results to see if coverage references are stale.  
    - Construct the list of Action items describing needed transformations.
```

### oops, URL calculation is missing (+2h)

- There should be a way to obtain FileURL for a given FileStructure
- Me: Edit design.md, FileURL construction

- Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to implement ## FileURL construction from #file:design.md ? Ask questions if needed.🏆
  - Answer:
    - Remote URL: How do we determine the repository's remote URL (e.g., "https://github.com/voedger/voedger")? This seems necessary to construct the RepoRootFolderURL. Should this be obtained through the Git interface?
    - Branch Name: The examples show URLs with "/blob/main/". Should we: Hardcode "main" as the branch name? Get it from the current branch? Make it configurable?
    - Platform Detection: The examples show different URL formats: GitHub: ".../blob/..." GitLab: ".../-/blob/..." How should we detect which platform format to use?
    - Branch Name in URLs The design has conflicting information:🏆
      - Git provider-specific path elements:
        - GitHub: `blob/main`
        - GitLab: `-/blob/main`
      - But also mentions: Actual current branch name

- Me: Prepare design of the ## File URL construction
- Claude: Rewrite this part professionally. Keep ALL names intact.👍

- loop ~10 times
  - Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to implement ## FileURL construction from #file:design.md ? Ask quiestions if needed
  - Me: Modify design
- Copilot.Claude: Based on your answers, I'll propose the implementation. We need to modify several files🏆

### cleanup

- Copilot.Claude: Identify LLMs notes that should be removed👍
  - The following line appears twice in the document and should be removed: Let me help you rewrite this technical documentation with a more professional structure and better formatting.
  - They are clearly meta-comments from an AI assistant and not part of the actual technical documentation. The content before and after these lines is legitimate design documentation and should remain in place.
- Copilot.Claude: Review the design:👍

### Implement main(): instantiate all necessary components and run Tracer

Yes, so far IApplier is not implemented, so we should prepare a dummy implementation, but the rest can be tested already.

- Copilot.Claude: Prepare a dummy implementation of IApplier in applier.go.
  - Failed first, had to add more to context☝️
- Copilot.Claude: Rewrite like git documentation, use unordered lists for identation, do not use spaces.🏆
  - Context: requirements.md, `### Tracing` section
- Me: Oops, analyzer is missed.
- Copilot.Claude: Implement dummy analyzer in analyzer.go. Ref. #file:interfaces.go , #file:models.go #file:scanner.go #file:applier.go #file:tracer.go👍
- Copilot.Claude
- Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to implement ### Tracing secction from the #file:requirements.md ? Ref. #interfaces.go  ,#models.go  #scanner.go  #applier.go  #tracer.go👍
- Me: Apply changes to main.go
- Copilot.Claude: rewrite main.go logic using cobra👍

Prompt

```text
Implement dummy analyzer in analyzer.go. Ref. #interfaces.go , #models.go #scanner.go #applier.go #tracer.go
```

### Run tests and make sure that the scanner works properly

- Me: it is necessary to process only specified file extensions in sources
- Copilot.Claude: I want to pass a list of source file extensions as argument s for reqmd trace, what you recommend?👍
- Me: Update the requirements.md
- Copilot.Claude: Fix design.md and scanner.go according to requirements.md (source file extensions)❌
  - Cause: main.go is missed in context
- Copilot.Claude: Fix design.md, main.go and scanner.go according to changes in requirements.md (source file extensions)👍

### Large source files are avoided

Input files that are larger than 128KB are not processed.

- Copilot.Claude: Apply requirements to scanner:
  - Files that are larger than 128K are skipped.
  - Only source files that are tracked by git (hash can be obtained) are processed.

- Copilot.Claude: scanner should Verbose number of encountered files and their total size, and number of skipped files and theit total size.👍

### Only one RequirementSite is allowed per line

- Copilot.Claude: Only one RequirementSite is allowed per line.🏆
  - Context: requirements.md, errors.go, mdparser.go
  - See the response in the Intermediate results section
- Copilot.Claude: Cover NewErrMultiSites by new TestParseRequirements_errors🏆

### Error: Opening fence found without matching closing fence

- Copilot.Claude: Implement "Opening fence found without matching closing fence"
  - Message includes line information about the opening fence🏆
  - See the response in the Intermediate results section

### Test "unmatchedfence" in TestMdParser_ParseMarkdownFile_Errors

- Copilot.Claude: Test "unmatchedfence" in TestMdParser_ParseMarkdownFile_Errors
  
### ActionAnnotate

- Copilot.Claude: Generate Action.String() method: OK
- Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to process ActionAnnotate in applier.go. It is necessary to annotate RequirementSite and add a coverage footnote. Use RequirementSiteRegex to identify RequirementSite. Ask questions, if needed.🏆
  - Context: #file:applier.go #file:requirements.md #file:ebnf.md #file:mdparser.go
- Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to implement `## ActionAnnotate processing` section  from the design.md? Ask questions, if needed.
  - Context: #file:applier.go #file:requirements.md #file:ebnf.md #file:mdparser.go
- Me: repeat the question multiple times. Response is incredibly cool🏆. An example:
  - When Action.Type is ActionAdd for footnotes:
    - Does Action.Data contain the complete footnote text?
    - Or do we need to construct it from some components?
    - Should we maintain any specific order of footnotes?

### reqmdfiles => reqmd.json

- CopilotAgent.Claude: Switch from reqmdfiles.json to reqmd.json🤔
  - Nothing on context
  - CopilotAgent found multiple files to change but still it is necessary to migrate from ReqmdfilesMap to Reqmdjson structure
- CopilotAgent.Claude: Migrate MarkdownContext.rfiles from ReqmdfilesMap to Reqmjson. Modify processing logic accordingly.👍
  - But tests do not work🤔
- CopilotAgent.Claude: Fix Test_ParseCoverageFootnote.👍
- Copilot.Claude: Implement custom JSON serialization for Reqmdjson to meet the requirements.👍

### Design: Changes processing

```text
## Changes processing

### Problem statement

The following files may have to be changed

- reqmd.json
- Markdown files
```

--------------------

## Intermediate results

### Prompt_CoverageFootnoteRegex

```text
Why 

CoverageFootnoteRegex = regexp.MustCompile(^\s*\[^~([^~]+)~\]:\s* + "")

does not match

line := "[^~REQ002~]: [~com.example.basic~impl][folder1/filename1:line1:impl](https://example.com/pkg1/filename1), [folder2/filename2:line2:test](https://example.com/pkg2/filename2)..."
```

### Test coverage footnote

```go
  // Test coverage footnote
  // [^~REQ002~]: `[~com.example.basic/REQ002~impl]` [folder1/filename1:line1:impl](https://example.com/pkg1/filename1), [folder2/filename2:line2:test](https://example.com/pkg2/filename2)
	{
		assert.Len(t, basicFile.CoverageFootnotes, 1, "should have 1 coverage footnote")
		if len(basicFile.CoverageFootnotes) > 0 {
			footnote := basicFile.CoverageFootnotes[0]
			assert.Equal(t, "REQ002", footnote.RequirementID, "incorrect requirement ID in footnote")
			assert.Equal(t, "com.example.basic", footnote.PackageID, "incorrect package ID in footnote")

			require.Len(t, footnote.Coverers, 2, "should have 2 coverage references")
			assert.Equal(t, "folder1/filename1:line1:impl", footnote.Coverers[0].CoverageLabel)
			assert.Equal(t, "https://example.com/pkg1/filename1", footnote.Coverers[0].CoverageURL)
			assert.Equal(t, "folder2/filename2:line2:test", footnote.Coverers[1].CoverageLabel)
			assert.Equal(t, "https://example.com/pkg2/filename2", footnote.Coverers[1].CoverageURL)
		}
	}
}
```

### Response: Only one RequirementSite is allowed per line

I'll help implement the "one RequirementSite per line" requirement. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Add a new error type for multiple requirements per line
2. Modify the ParseRequirements function to check for multiple matches
3. Add the corresponding error constructor in errors.go

#### [mdparser.go](file:///c%3A/workspaces/work/reqmd/internal/mdparser.go)

Modify ParseRequirements to check for multiple matches per line.

```go
// ...existing code...

func ParseRequirements(filePath string, line string, lineNum int, errors *[]ProcessingError) []RequirementSite {
	var requirements []RequirementSite

	matches := RequirementSiteRegex.FindAllStringSubmatch(line, -1)
	if len(matches) > 1 {
		*errors = append(*errors, NewErrMultipleRequirements(filePath, lineNum))
		return nil
	}
	
	for _, match := range matches {
		reqName := match[1]
		if !identifierRegex.MatchString(reqName) {
			*errors = append(*errors, NewErrReqIdent(filePath, lineNum))
		}
		// ...existing code...
	}

	return requirements
}

// ...existing code...
```

#### [errors.go](file:///c%3A/workspaces/work/reqmd/internal/errors.go)

Add the new error constructor for multiple requirements per line.

```go


Made changes.

// ...existing code...

func NewErrMultipleRequirements(filePath string, line int) ProcessingError {
	return ProcessingError{
		Code:     "multireq",
		FilePath: filePath,
		Line:     line,
		Message:  "Only one RequirementSite is allowed per line",
	}
}

// ...existing code...
```

The changes ensure that:

1. If multiple requirements are found on a single line, an error is reported
2. No requirements from that line are processed (returning nil)
3. The error message clearly indicates the violation of the one-requirement-per-line rule

Made changes.

### Response: Cover NewErrMultiSites by new TestParseRequirements_errors

I'll help add a test function to cover the NewErrMultiSites error case. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Create a new test function TestParseRequirements_errors
2. Include test cases for multiple requirement sites on a single line

```go
package internal

import (
	"testing"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestParseRequirements_errors(t *testing.T) {
	tests := []struct {
		name     string
		line     string
		wantErr  ProcessingError
	}{
		{
			name: "multiple requirements on single line",
			line: "`~REQ001~` `~REQ002~`",
			wantErr: ProcessingError{
				Code:     "multisites",
				FilePath: "test.md",
				Line:     1,
				Message:  "Only one RequirementSite is allowed per line: `~REQ001~`,  `~REQ002~`",
			},
		},
	}

	for _, tt := range tests {
		t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
			var errors []ProcessingError
			requirements := ParseRequirements("test.md", tt.line, 1, &errors)

			// Check that no requirements were returned
			assert.Nil(t, requirements, "should return nil requirements when multiple sites found")

			// Verify the error
			if assert.Len(t, errors, 1, "should have exactly one error") {
				assert.Equal(t, tt.wantErr.Code, errors[0].Code)
				assert.Equal(t, tt.wantErr.Message, errors[0].Message)
				assert.Equal(t, tt.wantErr.FilePath, errors[0].FilePath)
				assert.Equal(t, tt.wantErr.Line, errors[0].Line)
			}
		})
	}
}
```

The test:

1. Defines a test case with multiple requirement sites on a single line
2. Verifies that ParseRequirements returns nil for requirements
3. Checks that the correct error is generated with the expected properties
4. Uses the testify/assert package for cleaner assertions

You can add this test function to your existing mdparser_test.go file.

Made changes.

### Response: Is it clear how to process ActionAnnotate in applier.go

I have some questions about implementing ActionAnnotate in applier.go:

1. For line modification:
   - When we find a RequirementSite using RequirementSiteRegex, should we:
     - Replace just the bare requirement (e.g., "`~REQ001~`") with the annotated version (e.g., "`~REQ001~`covered[^~REQ001~]✅"), or
     - Preserve any existing coverage status and just update it?

2. For coverage footnotes:
   - Where exactly should new coverage footnotes be added in the file:
     - At the very end of the file?
     - After the last existing footnote?
     - After the section containing the requirement?

3. File handling:
   - Should we read the entire file into memory and modify it, or
   - Process it line by line with a scanner/writer?
   - Do we need to preserve original line endings (CRLF vs LF)?

4. Error handling:
   - What should happen if:
     - The file is read-only?
     - Multiple RequirementSites are found in a line (though this should be caught earlier)?
     - The line number in the action doesn't match where we find the requirement?

5. Backup:
   - Should we create a backup of the original file before modifying it?
   - Or should this be handled at a higher level?

Once these points are clarified, I can propose a specific implementation for the applier.go file.

### Response: Implement  "Opening fence found without matching closing fence"

I'll help you implement the unmatched code block fence error. Here's the solution:

1. First, we'll add a new error type in errors.go
2. Then modify mdparser.go to track code block fences and detect unmatched ones

#### [errors.go](file:///c%3A/projects/main/reqmd/internal/errors.go)

Add a new error function for unmatched code block fences.

```go
// ...existing code...

// Unmatched code block fence detected
func NewErrUnmatchedFence(filePath string, openFenceLine int) ProcessingError {
	return ProcessingError{
		Code:     "unmatchedfence",
		FilePath: filePath,
		Line:     openFenceLine,
		Message:  fmt.Sprintf("Opening code block fence at line %d has no matching closing fence", openFenceLine),
	}
}
```

#### [mdparser.go](file:///c%3A/projects/main/reqmd/internal/mdparser.go)

Modify ParseMarkdownFile to track code block fence positions and report unmatched fences.

```go


Made changes.

// ...existing code...

func ParseMarkdownFile(mctx *MarkdownContext, filePath string) (*FileStructure, []ProcessingError, error) {
	// ...existing code until inCodeBlock definition...

	var lastFenceLine int // Track the line number of the last opening fence

	for scanner.Scan() {
		lineNum++
		line := scanner.Text()

		// Check for code block markers, handling indentation
		if isCodeBlockMarker(line) {
			if !inCodeBlock {
				lastFenceLine = lineNum
				inCodeBlock = true
			} else {
				inCodeBlock = false
			}
			continue
		}

		// ...existing code...
	}

	// Check for unmatched fence at end of file
	if inCodeBlock {
		errors = append(errors, NewErrUnmatchedFence(filePath, lastFenceLine))
	}

	// ...rest of existing code...
}
```

This implementation:

1. Tracks the line number of opening code block fences
2. Maintains the state of being inside/outside a code block
3. If we reach the end of the file while still inside a code block (inCodeBlock is true), reports an error with the line number of the unmatched opening fence
4. Uses a new error type that provides clear information about where the unmatched fence was found

The error message will be helpful for users to locate and fix unmatched code block fences in their Markdown files.

Made changes.
