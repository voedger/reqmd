Prompt1

```text
Suggest a design for the implementation of the IAnalyzer that meets the fillowing requirements. Modify Action type if needed. Follow SOLID principles.

    - Determine which coverage footnotes need to be updated or created.  
    - Identify which bare requirement names need coverage annotations appended.  
    - Compare file hashes in reqmdfiles.json to actual git hash-object results to see if coverage references are stale.  
    - Construct the list of Action items describing needed transformations.
```

### oops, URL calculation is missing (+2h)

- There should be a way to obtain FileURL for a given FileStructure
- Me: Edit design.md, FileURL construction

- Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to implement ## FileURL construction from #file:design.md ? Ask questions if needed.üèÜ
  - Answer:
    - Remote URL: How do we determine the repository's remote URL (e.g., "https://github.com/voedger/voedger")? This seems necessary to construct the RepoRootFolderURL. Should this be obtained through the Git interface?
    - Branch Name: The examples show URLs with "/blob/main/". Should we: Hardcode "main" as the branch name? Get it from the current branch? Make it configurable?
    - Platform Detection: The examples show different URL formats: GitHub: ".../blob/..." GitLab: ".../-/blob/..." How should we detect which platform format to use?
    - Branch Name in URLs The design has conflicting information:üèÜ
      - Git provider-specific path elements:
        - GitHub: `blob/main`
        - GitLab: `-/blob/main`
      - But also mentions: Actual current branch name

- Me: Prepare design of the ## File URL construction
- Claude: Rewrite this part professionally. Keep ALL names intact.üëç

- loop ~10 times
  - Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to implement ## FileURL construction from #file:design.md ? Ask quiestions if needed
  - Me: Modify design
- Copilot.Claude: Based on your answers, I'll propose the implementation. We need to modify several filesüèÜ

### cleanup

- Copilot.Claude: Identify LLMs notes that should be removedüëç
  - The following line appears twice in the document and should be removed: Let me help you rewrite this technical documentation with a more professional structure and better formatting.
  - They are clearly meta-comments from an AI assistant and not part of the actual technical documentation. The content before and after these lines is legitimate design documentation and should remain in place.
- Copilot.Claude: Review the design:üëç

### Implement main(): instantiate all necessary components and run Tracer

Yes, so far IApplier is not implemented, so we should prepare a dummy implementation, but the rest can be tested already.

- Copilot.Claude: Prepare a dummy implementation of IApplier in applier.go.
  - Failed first, had to add more to context‚òùÔ∏è
- Copilot.Claude: Rewrite like git documentation, use unordered lists for identation, do not use spaces.üèÜ
  - Context: requirements.md, `### Tracing` section
- Me: Oops, analyzer is missed.
- Copilot.Claude: Implement dummy analyzer in analyzer.go. Ref. #file:interfaces.go , #file:models.go #file:scanner.go #file:applier.go #file:tracer.goüëç
- Copilot.Claude
- Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to implement ### Tracing secction from the #file:requirements.md ? Ref. #interfaces.go  ,#models.go  #scanner.go  #applier.go  #tracer.goüëç
- Me: Apply changes to main.go
- Copilot.Claude: rewrite main.go logic using cobraüëç

### Run tests and make sure that the scanner works properly

- Me: it is necessary to process only specified file extensions in sources
- Copilot.Claude: I want to pass a list of source file extensions as argument s for reqmd trace, what you recommend?üëç
- Me: Update the requirements.md
- Copilot.Claude: Fix design.md and scanner.go according to requirements.md (source file extensions)‚ùå
  - Cause: main.go is missed in context
- Copilot.Claude: Fix design.md, main.go and scanner.go according to changes in requirements.md (source file extensions)üëç

### Large source files are avoided

Input files that are larger than 128KB are not processed.

- Copilot.Claude: Apply requirements to scanner:
  - Files that are larger than 128K are skipped.
  - Only source files that are tracked by git (hash can be obtained) are processed.

- Copilot.Claude: scanner should Verbose number of encountered files and their total size, and number of skipped files and theit total size.üëç

### Only one RequirementSite is allowed per line

- Copilot.Claude: Only one RequirementSite is allowed per line.üèÜ
  - Context: requirements.md, errors.go, mdparser.go
  - See the response in the Intermediate results section
- Copilot.Claude: Cover NewErrMultiSites by new TestParseRequirements_errorsüèÜ

### ActionAnnotate

- Copilot.Claude: Generate Action.String() method: OK
- Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to process ActionAnnotate in applier.go. It is necessary to annotate RequirementSite and add a coverage footnote. Use RequirementSiteRegex to identify RequirementSite. Ask questions, if needed.üèÜ
  - Context: #file:applier.go #file:requirements.md #file:ebnf.md #file:mdparser.go
- Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to implement `## ActionAnnotate processing` section  from the design.md? Ask questions, if needed.
  - Context: #file:applier.go #file:requirements.md #file:ebnf.md #file:mdparser.go
- Me: repeat the question multiple times. Response is incredibly coolüèÜ. An example:
  - When Action.Type is ActionAdd for footnotes:
    - Does Action.Data contain the complete footnote text?
    - Or do we need to construct it from some components?
    - Should we maintain any specific order of footnotes?

## Intermediate results

### Prompt_CoverageFootnoteRegex

```text
Why 

CoverageFootnoteRegex = regexp.MustCompile(^\s*\[^~([^~]+)~\]:\s* + "")

does not match

line := "[^~REQ002~]: [~com.example.basic~impl][folder1/filename1:line1:impl](https://example.com/pkg1/filename1), [folder2/filename2:line2:test](https://example.com/pkg2/filename2)..."
```

### Test coverage footnote

```go
  // Test coverage footnote
  // [^~REQ002~]: `[~com.example.basic/REQ002~impl]` [folder1/filename1:line1:impl](https://example.com/pkg1/filename1), [folder2/filename2:line2:test](https://example.com/pkg2/filename2)
	{
		assert.Len(t, basicFile.CoverageFootnotes, 1, "should have 1 coverage footnote")
		if len(basicFile.CoverageFootnotes) > 0 {
			footnote := basicFile.CoverageFootnotes[0]
			assert.Equal(t, "REQ002", footnote.RequirementID, "incorrect requirement ID in footnote")
			assert.Equal(t, "com.example.basic", footnote.PackageID, "incorrect package ID in footnote")

			require.Len(t, footnote.Coverers, 2, "should have 2 coverage references")
			assert.Equal(t, "folder1/filename1:line1:impl", footnote.Coverers[0].CoverageLabel)
			assert.Equal(t, "https://example.com/pkg1/filename1", footnote.Coverers[0].CoverageURL)
			assert.Equal(t, "folder2/filename2:line2:test", footnote.Coverers[1].CoverageLabel)
			assert.Equal(t, "https://example.com/pkg2/filename2", footnote.Coverers[1].CoverageURL)
		}
	}
}
```

### Response: Only one RequirementSite is allowed per line

I'll help implement the "one RequirementSite per line" requirement. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Add a new error type for multiple requirements per line
2. Modify the ParseRequirements function to check for multiple matches
3. Add the corresponding error constructor in errors.go

#### [mdparser.go](file:///c%3A/workspaces/work/reqmd/internal/mdparser.go)

Modify ParseRequirements to check for multiple matches per line.

```go
// ...existing code...

func ParseRequirements(filePath string, line string, lineNum int, errors *[]ProcessingError) []RequirementSite {
	var requirements []RequirementSite

	matches := RequirementSiteRegex.FindAllStringSubmatch(line, -1)
	if len(matches) > 1 {
		*errors = append(*errors, NewErrMultipleRequirements(filePath, lineNum))
		return nil
	}
	
	for _, match := range matches {
		reqName := match[1]
		if !identifierRegex.MatchString(reqName) {
			*errors = append(*errors, NewErrReqIdent(filePath, lineNum))
		}
		// ...existing code...
	}

	return requirements
}

// ...existing code...
```

#### [errors.go](file:///c%3A/workspaces/work/reqmd/internal/errors.go)

Add the new error constructor for multiple requirements per line.

```go


Made changes.

// ...existing code...

func NewErrMultipleRequirements(filePath string, line int) ProcessingError {
	return ProcessingError{
		Code:     "multireq",
		FilePath: filePath,
		Line:     line,
		Message:  "Only one RequirementSite is allowed per line",
	}
}

// ...existing code...
```

The changes ensure that:

1. If multiple requirements are found on a single line, an error is reported
2. No requirements from that line are processed (returning nil)
3. The error message clearly indicates the violation of the one-requirement-per-line rule

Made changes.

### Response: Cover NewErrMultiSites by new TestParseRequirements_errors

I'll help add a test function to cover the NewErrMultiSites error case. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Create a new test function TestParseRequirements_errors
2. Include test cases for multiple requirement sites on a single line

```go
package internal

import (
	"testing"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestParseRequirements_errors(t *testing.T) {
	tests := []struct {
		name     string
		line     string
		wantErr  ProcessingError
	}{
		{
			name: "multiple requirements on single line",
			line: "`~REQ001~` `~REQ002~`",
			wantErr: ProcessingError{
				Code:     "multisites",
				FilePath: "test.md",
				Line:     1,
				Message:  "Only one RequirementSite is allowed per line: `~REQ001~`,  `~REQ002~`",
			},
		},
	}

	for _, tt := range tests {
		t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
			var errors []ProcessingError
			requirements := ParseRequirements("test.md", tt.line, 1, &errors)

			// Check that no requirements were returned
			assert.Nil(t, requirements, "should return nil requirements when multiple sites found")

			// Verify the error
			if assert.Len(t, errors, 1, "should have exactly one error") {
				assert.Equal(t, tt.wantErr.Code, errors[0].Code)
				assert.Equal(t, tt.wantErr.Message, errors[0].Message)
				assert.Equal(t, tt.wantErr.FilePath, errors[0].FilePath)
				assert.Equal(t, tt.wantErr.Line, errors[0].Line)
			}
		})
	}
}
```

The test:

1. Defines a test case with multiple requirement sites on a single line
2. Verifies that ParseRequirements returns nil for requirements
3. Checks that the correct error is generated with the expected properties
4. Uses the testify/assert package for cleaner assertions

You can add this test function to your existing mdparser_test.go file.

Made changes.

### Response: Is it clear how to process ActionAnnotate in applier.go

I have some questions about implementing ActionAnnotate in applier.go:

1. For line modification:
   - When we find a RequirementSite using RequirementSiteRegex, should we:
     - Replace just the bare requirement (e.g., "`~REQ001~`") with the annotated version (e.g., "`~REQ001~`covered[^~REQ001~]‚úÖ"), or
     - Preserve any existing coverage status and just update it?

2. For coverage footnotes:
   - Where exactly should new coverage footnotes be added in the file:
     - At the very end of the file?
     - After the last existing footnote?
     - After the section containing the requirement?

3. File handling:
   - Should we read the entire file into memory and modify it, or
   - Process it line by line with a scanner/writer?
   - Do we need to preserve original line endings (CRLF vs LF)?

4. Error handling:
   - What should happen if:
     - The file is read-only?
     - Multiple RequirementSites are found in a line (though this should be caught earlier)?
     - The line number in the action doesn't match where we find the requirement?

5. Backup:
   - Should we create a backup of the original file before modifying it?
   - Or should this be handled at a higher level?

Once these points are clarified, I can propose a specific implementation for the applier.go file.
