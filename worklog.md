Prompt1

```text
Suggest a design for the implementation of the IAnalyzer that meets the fillowing requirements. Modify Action type if needed. Follow SOLID principles.

    - Determine which coverage footnotes need to be updated or created.  
    - Identify which bare requirement names need coverage annotations appended.  
    - Compare file hashes in reqmdfiles.json to actual git hash-object results to see if coverage references are stale.  
    - Construct the list of Action items describing needed transformations.
```

### 003: oops, URL calculation is missing (+2h)

- There should be a way to obtain FileURL for a given FileStructure
- Me: Edit design.md, FileURL construction

- Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to implement ## FileURL construction from #file:design.md ? Ask questions if needed.üèÜ
  - Answer:
    - Remote URL: How do we determine the repository's remote URL (e.g., "https://github.com/voedger/voedger")? This seems necessary to construct the RepoRootFolderURL. Should this be obtained through the Git interface?
    - Branch Name: The examples show URLs with "/blob/main/". Should we: Hardcode "main" as the branch name? Get it from the current branch? Make it configurable?
    - Platform Detection: The examples show different URL formats: GitHub: ".../blob/..." GitLab: ".../-/blob/..." How should we detect which platform format to use?
    - Branch Name in URLs The design has conflicting information:üèÜ
      - Git provider-specific path elements:
        - GitHub: `blob/main`
        - GitLab: `-/blob/main`
      - But also mentions: Actual current branch name

- Me: Prepare design of the ## File URL construction
- Claude: Rewrite this part professionally. Keep ALL names intact.üëç

- loop ~10 times
  - Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to implement ## FileURL construction from #file:design.md ? Ask quiestions if needed
  - Me: Modify design
- Copilot.Claude: Based on your answers, I'll propose the implementation. We need to modify several filesüèÜ

### 004: cleanup

- Copilot.Claude: Identify LLMs notes that should be removedüëç
  - The following line appears twice in the document and should be removed: Let me help you rewrite this technical documentation with a more professional structure and better formatting.
  - They are clearly meta-comments from an AI assistant and not part of the actual technical documentation. The content before and after these lines is legitimate design documentation and should remain in place.
- Copilot.Claude: Review the design:üëç

### 005: Implement main(): instantiate all necessary components and run Tracer

Yes, so far IApplier is not implemented, so we should prepare a dummy implementation, but the rest can be tested already.

- Copilot.Claude: Prepare a dummy implementation of IApplier in applier.go.
  - Failed first, had to add more to context‚òùÔ∏è
- Copilot.Claude: Rewrite like git documentation, use unordered lists for identation, do not use spaces.üèÜ
  - Context: requirements.md, `### Tracing` section
- Me: Oops, analyzer is missed.
- Copilot.Claude: Implement dummy analyzer in analyzer.go. Ref. #file:interfaces.go , #file:models.go #file:scanner.go #file:applier.go #file:tracer.goüëç
- Copilot.Claude
- Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to implement ### Tracing secction from the #file:requirements.md ? Ref. #interfaces.go  ,#models.go  #scanner.go  #applier.go  #tracer.goüëç
- Me: Apply changes to main.go
- Copilot.Claude: rewrite main.go logic using cobraüëç

Prompt

```text
Implement dummy analyzer in analyzer.go. Ref. #interfaces.go , #models.go #scanner.go #applier.go #tracer.go
```

### 006: Run tests and make sure that the scanner works properly

- Me: it is necessary to process only specified file extensions in sources
- Copilot.Claude: I want to pass a list of source file extensions as argument s for reqmd trace, what you recommend?üëç
- Me: Update the requirements.md
- Copilot.Claude: Fix design.md and scanner.go according to requirements.md (source file extensions)‚ùå
  - Cause: main.go is missed in context
- Copilot.Claude: Fix design.md, main.go and scanner.go according to changes in requirements.md (source file extensions)üëç

### 007: Large source files are avoided

Input files that are larger than 128KB are not processed.

- Copilot.Claude: Apply requirements to scanner:
  - Files that are larger than 128K are skipped.
  - Only source files that are tracked by git (hash can be obtained) are processed.

- Copilot.Claude: scanner should Verbose number of encountered files and their total size, and number of skipped files and theit total size.üëç

### 008: Only one RequirementSite is allowed per line

- Copilot.Claude: Only one RequirementSite is allowed per line.üèÜ
  - Context: requirements.md, errors.go, mdparser.go
  - See the response in the Intermediate results section
- Copilot.Claude: Cover NewErrMultiSites by new TestParseRequirements_errorsüèÜ

### 009: Error: Opening fence found without matching closing fence

- Copilot.Claude: Implement "Opening fence found without matching closing fence"
  - Message includes line information about the opening fenceüèÜ
  - See the response in the Intermediate results section

### 010: Test "unmatchedfence" in TestMdParser_ParseMarkdownFile_Errors

- Copilot.Claude: Test "unmatchedfence" in TestMdParser_ParseMarkdownFile_Errors
  
### 011: ActionAnnotate

- Copilot.Claude: Generate Action.String() method: OK
- Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to process ActionAnnotate in applier.go. It is necessary to annotate RequirementSite and add a coverage footnote. Use RequirementSiteRegex to identify RequirementSite. Ask questions, if needed.üèÜ
  - Context: #file:applier.go #file:requirements.md #file:ebnf.md #file:mdparser.go
- Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to implement `## ActionAnnotate processing` section  from the design.md? Ask questions, if needed.
  - Context: #file:applier.go #file:requirements.md #file:ebnf.md #file:mdparser.go
- Me: repeat the question multiple times. Response is incredibly coolüèÜ. An example:
  - When Action.Type is ActionAdd for footnotes:
    - Does Action.Data contain the complete footnote text?
    - Or do we need to construct it from some components?
    - Should we maintain any specific order of footnotes?

### 012: reqmdfiles => reqmd.json

- CopilotAgent.Claude: Switch from reqmdfiles.json to reqmd.jsonü§î
  - Nothing on context
  - CopilotAgent found multiple files to change but still it is necessary to migrate from ReqmdfilesMap to Reqmdjson structure
- CopilotAgent.Claude: Migrate MarkdownContext.rfiles from ReqmdfilesMap to Reqmjson. Modify processing logic accordingly.üëç
  - But tests do not workü§î
- CopilotAgent.Claude: Fix Test_ParseCoverageFootnote.üëç
- Copilot.Claude: Implement custom JSON serialization for Reqmdjson to meet the requirements.üëç

### 013: Design: Changes processing

- Me: design.md/Changes processing
- Me: loop
  - Copilot.Claude: Finalize the `design.md/##Changes processing` section. Ask questions, if needed.

```textüèÜ
2. **CoverageStatusWord Updates**:
   - There seems to be a potential inconsistency in the logic:
	 - If coverers = 0 and status = "uncvrd" ‚Üí change to "covered"
     - If coverers > 0 and status = "covered" ‚Üí change to "uncvrd"
   - Shouldn't it be the opposite?
     - If coverers = 0 ‚Üí should be "uncvrd" (uncovered)
     - If coverers > 0 ‚Üí should be "covered"

...
Yes, I have reviewed the Changes Processing section in detail and I see a few points that need clarification:

1. **CoverageStatusWord Logic**:
   If the number of coverers is non-zero and current Coverage.StatusWord is "uncvrd" then it is changed to "covered"
   If the number of coverers is zero and current Coverage.StatusWord is "covered" then it is changed to "uncvrd"

   This logic appears correct - unlike my earlier concern. When there are coverers, the status changes to "covered", and when there are no coverers, it changes to "uncvrd".	 
```

### 014: Construction: Changes processing

- CopilotAgent.Claude: Implement the `design.md/##Changes processing` for the analyzer.ü§î
  - In general it is ok, but the processing for ActionAddCoverer, ActionRemoveCoverer are missing.
- CopilotAgent.Claude: Refactor RequirementSite.CoverageStatusWord processing to meet the requirements:üëç
  - If the number of new coverers (including new ones) is non-zero and current Coverage.StatusWord is "uncvrd" then it is changed to "covered"
  - If the number of coverers is zero (considering those that no longer exist) and current Coverage.StatusWord is "covered" then it is changed to "uncvrd"
- Me: Oops, ambiguous design. Redesign.
- Me: loop
  - Copilot.Claude: Is `design.md/##Changes processing` clear to refactor Analyzer? Ask questions if needed.
- CopilotAgent.Claude: Refactor analyzer to meet the design

- CopilotAgent.Claude: Refactor code so that:üëç
  - IScanner shall return (*ScannerResult, []ProcessingError, error)
  - IAnalyzer shall return (*AnalyzerResult, []ProcessingError, error)
- Me: Analyzer has to be rebuilt since the design is changed. Current [version](https://github.com/voedger/reqmd/tree/a08fc356d8825823a53717603d8f30f02b16ab88) :(
- Me: loop
  - Copilot.Claude: Is `design.md/#### Construction of ActionFootnote and ActionUpdateStatus` clear to refactor Analyzer? Ask questions if needed.üëç

- CopilotAgent.Claude: analyzer_test.go: Construct tests to cover ActionFootnote and ActionUpdateStatus.  Do not use table tests, use separate Runs. Construct new helper functions to create FileStructures and other structs, if needed.

### 015: Dry run option

- Copilot.Claude: Add dry-run option, similar to git,  to requirements.md. Implement it in main.go, applier.go. Applier shall just output all actions, like in verbode modeü§î
  - Oops: I want to  pass an argument to the Applier factory, not add new method to the Applier interface
- Copilot.Claude: Add `--dry-run` option, similar to git,  to requirements.md. Implement it in main.go, applier.go. Applier shall just output all actions, like in verbode mode. Pass dry run option to the Applier factory.

### 016: `func applyMdActions(_ FilePath, _ []MdAction) error`

- Copilot.Claude: Implement `func applyMdActions`. Do not create tests yet.ü§î
  - Context: applier.go, models.go
  - Better function descirption is needed.

### 017: Apply Reqmdjson actions

- Me: loop
  - Copilot.o1: Is `design.md/### Apply Regmdjson actions` clear to implement applyReqmdjsons()? Ask questions if needed.ü§î
    - Context: design.md, analyzer.go, applier.go, models.go
  - Copilot.CLaude: Is `design.md/### Apply Regmdjson actions` clear to implement applyReqmdjsons()? Ask questions if needed.

### 018: Run against a real project and fix issues (3h)

### 019: CoverageFootnoteReference shall not use RequirementSiteID

Lexical element:

```ebnf
CoverageFootnoteID = "cf" Number
```

```ebnf
CoverageFootnoteReference = "[^" CoverageFootnoteID "]
CoverageFootnote = "[^" CoverageFootnoteID "]" ":" "`[" CoverageFootnoteHint "]`" [Coverers]
```

Implementation requirements:

	}
}
```

### Response: Only one RequirementSite is allowed per line

I'll help implement the "one RequirementSite per line" requirement. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Add a new error type for multiple requirements per line
2. Modify the ParseRequirements function to check for multiple matches
3. Add the corresponding error constructor in errors.go

#### [mdparser.go](file:///c%3A/workspaces/work/reqmd/internal/mdparser.go)

Modify ParseRequirements to check for multiple matches per line.

```go
// ...existing code...

func ParseRequirements(filePath string, line string, lineNum int, errors *[]ProcessingError) []RequirementSite {
	var requirements []RequirementSite

	matches := RequirementSiteRegex.FindAllStringSubmatch(line, -1)
	if len(matches) > 1 {
		*errors = append(*errors, NewErrMultipleRequirements(filePath, lineNum))
		return nil
	}
	
	for _, match := range matches {
		reqName := match[1]
		if !identifierRegex.MatchString(reqName) {
			*errors = append(*errors, NewErrReqIdent(filePath, lineNum))
		}
		// ...existing code...
	}

	return requirements
}

// ...existing code...
```

#### [errors.go](file:///c%3A/workspaces/work/reqmd/internal/errors.go)

Add the new error constructor for multiple requirements per line.

```go


Made changes.

// ...existing code...

func NewErrMultipleRequirements(filePath string, line int) ProcessingError {
	return ProcessingError{
		Code:     "multireq",
		FilePath: filePath,
		Line:     line,
		Message:  "Only one RequirementSite is allowed per line",
	}
}

// ...existing code...
```

The changes ensure that:

1. If multiple requirements are found on a single line, an error is reported
2. No requirements from that line are processed (returning nil)
3. The error message clearly indicates the violation of the one-requirement-per-line rule

Made changes.

### Response: Cover NewErrMultiSites by new TestParseRequirements_errors

I'll help add a test function to cover the NewErrMultiSites error case. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Create a new test function TestParseRequirements_errors
2. Include test cases for multiple requirement sites on a single line

```go
package internal

import (
	"testing"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestParseRequirements_errors(t *testing.T) {
	tests := []struct {
		name     string
		line     string
		wantErr  ProcessingError
	}{
		{
			name: "multiple requirements on single line",
			line: "`~REQ001~` `~REQ002~`",
			wantErr: ProcessingError{
				Code:     "multisites",
				FilePath: "test.md",
				Line:     1,
				Message:  "Only one RequirementSite is allowed per line: `~REQ001~`,  `~REQ002~`",
			},
		},
	}

	for _, tt := range tests {
		t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
			var errors []ProcessingError
			requirements := ParseRequirements("test.md", tt.line, 1, &errors)

			// Check that no requirements were returned
			assert.Nil(t, requirements, "should return nil requirements when multiple sites found")

			// Verify the error
			if assert.Len(t, errors, 1, "should have exactly one error") {
				assert.Equal(t, tt.wantErr.Code, errors[0].Code)
				assert.Equal(t, tt.wantErr.Message, errors[0].Message)
				assert.Equal(t, tt.wantErr.FilePath, errors[0].FilePath)
				assert.Equal(t, tt.wantErr.Line, errors[0].Line)
			}
		})
	}
}
```

The test:

1. Defines a test case with multiple requirement sites on a single line
2. Verifies that ParseRequirements returns nil for requirements
3. Checks that the correct error is generated with the expected properties
4. Uses the testify/assert package for cleaner assertions

You can add this test function to your existing mdparser_test.go file.

Made changes.

### Response: Is it clear how to process ActionAnnotate in applier.go

I have some questions about implementing ActionAnnotate in applier.go:

1. For line modification:
   - When we find a RequirementSite using RequirementSiteRegex, should we:
     - Replace just the bare requirement (e.g., "`~REQ001~`") with the annotated version (e.g., "`~REQ001~`covered[^~REQ001~]‚úÖ"), or
     - Preserve any existing coverage status and just update it?

2. For coverage footnotes:
   - Where exactly should new coverage footnotes be added in the file:
     - At the very end of the file?
     - After the last existing footnote?
     - After the section containing the requirement?

3. File handling:
   - Should we read the entire file into memory and modify it, or
   - Process it line by line with a scanner/writer?
   - Do we need to preserve original line endings (CRLF vs LF)?

4. Error handling:
   - What should happen if:
     - The file is read-only?
     - Multiple RequirementSites are found in a line (though this should be caught earlier)?
     - The line number in the action doesn't match where we find the requirement?

5. Backup:
   - Should we create a backup of the original file before modifying it?
   - Or should this be handled at a higher level?

Once these points are clarified, I can propose a specific implementation for the applier.go file.

### Response: Implement  "Opening fence found without matching closing fence"

I'll help you implement the unmatched code block fence error. Here's the solution:

1. First, we'll add a new error type in errors.go
2. Then modify mdparser.go to track code block fences and detect unmatched ones

#### [errors.go](file:///c%3A/projects/main/reqmd/internal/errors.go)

Add a new error function for unmatched code block fences.

```go
// ...existing code...

// Unmatched code block fence detected
func NewErrUnmatchedFence(filePath string, openFenceLine int) ProcessingError {
	return ProcessingError{
		Code:     "unmatchedfence",
		FilePath: filePath,
		Line:     openFenceLine,
		Message:  fmt.Sprintf("Opening code block fence at line %d has no matching closing fence", openFenceLine),
	}
}
```

#### [mdparser.go](file:///c%3A/projects/main/reqmd/internal/mdparser.go)

Modify ParseMarkdownFile to track code block fence positions and report unmatched fences.

```go

// ...existing code...

func ParseMarkdownFile(mctx *MarkdownContext, filePath string) (*FileStructure, []ProcessingError, error) {
	// ...existing code until inCodeBlock definition...

	var lastFenceLine int // Track the line number of the last opening fence

	for scanner.Scan() {
		lineNum++
		line := scanner.Text()

		// Check for code block markers, handling indentation
		if isCodeBlockMarker(line) {
			if !inCodeBlock {
				lastFenceLine = lineNum
				inCodeBlock = true
			} else {
				inCodeBlock = false
			}
			continue
		}

		// ...existing code...
	}

	if inCodeBlock {
		errors = append(errors, NewErrUnmatchedFence(filePath, lastFenceLine))
	}

	// ...rest of existing code...
}
```

This implementation:

1. Tracks the line number of opening code block fences
2. Maintains the state of being inside/outside a code block
3. If we reach the end of the file while still inside a code block (inCodeBlock is true), reports an error with the line number of the unmatched opening fence
4. Uses a new error type that provides clear information about where the unmatched fence was found

The error message will be helpful for users to locate and fix unmatched code block fences in their Markdown files.

## Analysis

- Presumably: ChatGPT-4 produces better quality text content

### Cool prompts and other findings

- Copilot.Claude: Is it clear how to implement ### Tracing section from the #file:requirements.md ? Ref. #interfaces.go  ,#models.go  #scanner.go  #applier.go  #tracer.go. Ask questions, if needed.üëç
- Copilot.CLaude: Is `design.md/### Apply Regmdjson actions` clear to implement applyReqmdjsons()? Ask questions if needed.
  - ‚ö°Yes, the requirements in design.md are clear and the available code provides all needed functionality. Let me summarize the key requirements and implementation details:
  - Create a new chat if requirements/design are changed
- Copilot.Claude: Finalize the `design.md/##Changes processing` section. Ask questions, if needed.
- Copilot.Claude: Implement dummy analyzer in analyzer.go. Ref. #interfaces.go , #models.go #scanner.go #applier.go #tracer
- Me: Oops, models.go does not match the design (created it manually)
- It is cool to review each function using UI (it is way faster then Copilot) but it takes more time in total
- Provide implementation details: coversions is made reading lines one by one and tracking the status (finite-state machine)
