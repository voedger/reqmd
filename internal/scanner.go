An exerpt from design.md

- **Purpose**: Implements `IScanner`.
- **Key functions**:
  - `Scan`:
    - Recursively discover Markdown and source files.
    - Delegate parsing to specialized components (`mdparser.go`, `srccoverparser.go`).
    - Build a unified list of `FileStructure` objects for each file.
    - Collect any `SyntaxError`s.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Single responsibility: collecting raw data (files, coverage tags, requirement references) and building the domain model.
  - Potential concurrency (goroutines) for scanning subfolders.

*/

/*

- Each path is processed in a separate goroutine.
- First path is processed as path to requirement files
- Other paths are processed as path to source files

*/
