# High-volume file processing

## Requirements

Implement a comprehensive system test that processes thousands of files to validate performance and stability under high load conditions.

## Principles

- Generate test data programmatically to create a realistic high-volume scenario

### Test architecture
  
- `hvGenerator()` generates test files with configurable parameters:
  - Number of markdown files (1,000+)
  - Number of source files (10,000+)
  - Number of requirements per markdown file (10-100)
  - Number of implementations per requirement (1-20)
- Generate files with realistic content patterns and varying complexity
