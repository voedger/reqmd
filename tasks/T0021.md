# Unify markdown and source file processing

## Background

The current implementation of reqmd separates the processing of markdown files and source files into distinct paths:

```bash
reqmd [-v] trace [ (-e | --extensions) <extensions>] [--dry-run | -n] <path-to-markdowns> [<path-to-sources>...]
```

This separation is reflected throughout the requirements, analysis, and source code

## Problem statement

The current approach presents several limitations:

1. **Unnecessary complexity**: The separation between markdown and source files adds complexity without providing significant benefits
2. **Limited flexibility**: The single path parameter for markdown files restricts the ability to process multiple markdown directories within a repository

## Proposed solution

Modify reqmd to accept multiple paths, where each path can contain both markdown and source files. This change will:

- Simplify the command-line interface
- Improve flexibility for processing multiple directories
- Better reflect real-world repository structures where markdown and source files are often intermingled

## Implementation plan

1. **Documentation updates**:
   - [x] Update requirements.md to reflect new multi-path approach
   - [x] Modify design.md to document architectural changes
   - [x] Add examples for multi-path usage

2. **Command-line interface updates**:
   - [x] Modify argument parsing to accept multiple paths
   - [x] Add validation for path arguments

3. **Core logic modifications**:
   - [x] 1. Implement ParseFile that merges ParseSourceFile and ParseMarkdownFile
   - [x] 2. Implement ParseFile that merges ParseSourceFile and ParseMarkdownFile
   - [ ] ScanMultiPath
      - Rename processSourceFile to processFile
      - Make processSourceFile process markdown files
   - Remove mdparser.go and srcparser.go

4. **Testing strategy**:
   - [ ] Create test cases with mixed markdown and source files
   - [ ] Verify behavior with multiple directory structures
   - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing use cases
